# Code Portfolio
 
Hi! My name is Tiger Jia and welcome to my code portfolio! This repository currently contains code for an in-progress project written in C# for [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/). The project is a Bullet Heaven/Vampire Survivors style game with higher input interaction and more involved boss fights with telegraphs.

## Highlights

- A player controller with 6 different activatable abilities ([Player.cs](Project1/Player.cs))
- A stat system with buffs and defuffs ([EntityData.cs](Project1/EntityData.cs), [Entity.cs](Project1/Entity.cs))
- In-engine tooling and resources that allows creating complex enemy attack patterns ([Pattern.cs](Project1/Pattern.cs), [Enemy.cs](Project1/Enemy.cs), [Attack.cs](Project1/Attack.cs))
